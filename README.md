# Nesto's Data Analyst Portfolio

## My Personal Dashbord prereviews as a Data Analyst, giving a business intelligence insight on projects.

### These are some personal project being carried out and i was able to give some business insight to a business owner and creating a better understanding between the business and the owner of business. 

### Each Chart shows the progress of the business from previous years to current year: when the business is doing well for each month, each click shows its process and when the business is not doing well, each click shows the months its not doing well. 

### This is where i come in as an analyst, i tend to give suggestions on neccessary actions to take to improve the flow of the business and suggestions on how to improve productivity and reduce expenditure if necessary.
